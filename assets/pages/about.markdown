My name is **Ganesh Belgur Ramachandra**. My primary area of interest lies in rendering techniques from computer graphics. Game engine architecture, shader writing, simulation and graphics device drivers form my extended areas of interest. Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en.html">Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)</a> on developing and maintaining open-source, Linux graphics software drivers for upcoming and existing Radeon chips under the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa">Mesa project</a> initiative. My strongest skillsets are in C/C++ and modern graphics programming.

In the past, I worked on Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software development for the luxury segment vehicles by General Motors under <a href="https://www.rampgroup.com/casestudy_generalmotors.html">Ramp Group</a>, a subsidiary of People Tech Group. As part of the global computer graphics software team at <a href="https://www.mpcvfx.com/en/about/">MPC Film</a>, I developed and maintained the CG hair, fur and feather grooming tool called <a href="https://www.mpcvfx.com/en/site-search/?_keyword=Furtility">Furtility</a>, which earned me several feature film credits. Please feel free to head over to my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10166225/">IMDB page</a> to see my list of Hollywood feature film on-screen credits.

In my leisure time, I enjoy watching films, reading books and technical blogs, working on personal projects, and spending time outdoors. I love modern and classical western instrumental music.
